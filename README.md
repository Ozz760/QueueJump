## Installation

To use this application, you will need a database such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) along with [MongodbCompass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) and a sandbox to test the queries/mutations such as the software [ApolloGraphql](https://www.apollographql.com/). With the app open in your terminal (or in VSCode's integrated terminal), it is imperative that you run "npm i" in order to download the required node dependencies.

## Usage

Navigate to the deployed heroku application: [QueueJump Heroku](link) and then make sure to set up your environmental variables: Run ```.cp .env.Example .env``` in order to get a copy and then input your own values in VSCode and Heroku. Also connect to your database such as [MongodbAtlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).
